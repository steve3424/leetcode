- Traversing each
- Adding / removing from each
- Downsides of each

- Binary tree
- different ways to traverse
- Importance of keeping it balanced
- Relation to linked list in pathological case
- logn

- Sorting
- Basic classes of sorts
	- n^2, nlogn, linear
	- insertion / bubble, merge / quick, counting sort

- graphs
- dykstra / A*

- string structures
- substring algorithms

- recursion 

- hash table
- relation to arrays

- basic diff between logn, n, n^2
- linear search vs binary search
